    "## Introduction to Machine Learning\n",
    "AI, Data Science and Machine Learning are contributing tremendously to tech and developments in the modern era. They have changed how we live our everyday lives. Examples of applications integrating machine learning include:\n",
    "1. Recommendation systems on Youtube, Netflix.\n",
    "2. Self Driving cars.\n",
    "3. Face detection systems\n",
    "4. Virtual assistants such as Alexa, Siri\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Machine learning is a subfield of artificial intelligence (AI). The goal of machine learning generally is to understand the structure of data and fit that data into models that can be understood and utilized by people.\n",
    "\n",
    "Machine Learning can also be defined as the field of study that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed. "

    "Math is important when it comes to understanding some of the integral coding aspects involved in machine learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "Linear algebra, calculus (both integral and differential, but mostly the aspects of differentiation), probability, and statistics are the topics to focus on.\n",
    "\n",
    "The purpose for learning linear algebra, vectors and dimensional spaces, dot products, and their angular products, projections and unit vectors, other essential equations pertaining to all the major topics involved in 2-D and 3-Dimensional spaces such as circles, rectangles, spheres, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main reason for you to focus on differential calculus is because of the topics like backpropagation which is extremely crucial to understand the concept of neural networks. Differentiation is vital for breaking down numerous concepts and topics from scratch and gain a more intuitive understanding of these algorithms, procedures, and computations exactly work.\n",
    "\n",
    "Machine learning involves a lot of uncertainty. Whether you are performing tasks like classification or regression, there is almost some amount of measure where the model is not confident about the possible outcome. For this reason, knowledge of probability is vital to break down the numerous concepts of machine learning. Also, it is important to note that topics and machine learning algorithms like Naïve Bayes algorithms require the use of probability to master the following ideas."

    "In supervised learning, the computer is provided with example inputs that are labeled with their desired outputs. The purpose of this method is for the algorithm to be able to “learn” by comparing its actual output with the “taught” outputs to find errors, and modify the model accordingly. Supervised learning therefore uses patterns to predict label values on additional unlabeled data.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, with supervised learning, an algorithm may be fed data with images of sharks labeled as fish and images of oceans labeled as water. By being trained on this data, the supervised learning algorithm should be able to later identify unlabeled shark images as fish and unlabeled ocean images as water.\n",

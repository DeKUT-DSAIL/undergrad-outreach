    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Python</b> is a high level object oriented programming language created by Guido van Rossum and released in 1991. It's called a <b>general purpose programming</b> language because it is used in almost every domain you can think of. Examples of companies that use python include NASA, Netflix, Instagram, Google and Facebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is ised in:\n",
    "1. <b>Web development</b> - python offers different frameworks for web deveopment like Flask, Django and Pyramid. \n",
    "2. <b>Game development</b> - python libraries used for game dvelopment include Pysoy and PyGame\n",
    "3. <b>Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning</b> - python has alot of open-source libraries for AI/ML applications.\n",
    "4. <b>Data Analytics</b>\n",
    "5. <b>Software development</b>\n",
    "\n",
    "### Pros of using python\n",
    "1. Python works on different platforms (Windows, Linux, Raspberry Pi and Jetson nano)\n",
    "2. Python has a <b>simple syntax</b> similar to English making it easily readable and allowing developers to write programs with fewer lines of code.\n",
    "3. It is <b>free, open source</b> and it has many built-in and <b>pre-defined libraries</b> making a developer's job easy.\n",
    "4. Python is easy to learn and implement.\n",
    "5. Python runs on an <b>interpreter system</b>, meaning code can be executed as soon as it is written.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Cons of using python\n",
    "1. Python is <b>slower</b> than C or C++. C has compiled language. The complete source code is converted into a machine language which is easier for a computer to understand. Python on the other hand is interpreted. The interpreter reads each statement line by line. This makes python slower compared to C.\n",
    "2. Python's <b>memory consumption is high</b> therefore not a good choice for memory intensive tasks.\n",
    "3. Python has limitations with <b>database</b> access.\n",
    "4. Python requires more testing because it is <b>dynamically typed</b>.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Other IDE's you can use with python\n",
    "1. [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/)\n",
    "2. [Pycharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/)\n",
    "3. [Spyder](https://www.spyder-ide.org/)\n",
    "4. [Atom](https://atom.io/)\n",
    "5. [Google Colab](https://research.google.com/colaboratory/)"
